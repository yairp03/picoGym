## Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

# Solution

We are given a website with the title `Inspect Me`. That hints that we should inspect the source code of the website. We can do so by right-clicking anywhere on the page and clicking and clicking `Inspect`. Alternatively, we can press `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows or `Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac. Now that the browser's developer tools are open, we can navigate to the `Sources` tab. There, we can see all the source files for the website.

Starting with `(index)`, which is the main html page, we can see this comment at the bottom of the file:

```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```

We got the first third of the flag! There are more files to inspect, let's check out `mycss.css`. Here as well, another comment with the second third of the flag:

```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```

Finally, we can check out `myjs.js` for the last third of the flag:

```js
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2e7b23e3} */
```

Putting all the parts together, we get the flag.


**The Flag:** `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}`
