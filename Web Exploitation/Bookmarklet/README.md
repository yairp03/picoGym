## Description

Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:54158/), and find the flag!

# Solution

Looking at the website, it says that it gave us the flag, and then there is a text box with JavaScript code in it. This is a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a bookmark that contains JavaScript code that is executed when the bookmark is clicked. This bookmarklet seems to be decrypting the hardcoded encrypted flag, and alerting it. We can just copy the code and paste it into the console to get the flag.

**The Flag:** `picoCTF{p@g3_turn3r_18d2fa20}`
