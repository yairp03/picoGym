# Challenge

## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27393/. Can you find it?

# Solution

Here we are given a simple website with two not so interesting pages. The second page ("What" page) note that the website uses HTML, CSS, and JS. Looking at the HTML source of the page, we see this comment:

```
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

We got the first part of the flag! Let's move on to the CSS file:

```
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

There is the second part. Now when looking at the JS file, we see a different type of comment there:

```
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

A quick google search will show that the `robots.txt` file is used to tell search engines which pages not to index. Let's try to access the `robots.txt` file on the website:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

We got the third part of the flag, and a hint about the next part. We need to find a file that will match this hint. Also, we can see that the word `Access` is capitalized. After some trial and error, I found that googling `apache server access file` gives us the `.htaccess` file. Let's try to access it:

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

We got part 4. This time, the google query I used was `mac store file`. The answer is the `.DS_Store` file. Let's try to access it:

```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _d375c750}
```

We got the last part! Combining all the parts we got so far gives us the flag.

**The Flag:** `picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_d375c750}`
