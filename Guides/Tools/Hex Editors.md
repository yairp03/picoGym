# Hex Editors

A hex editor is a program that allows you to view and edit the raw contents of a file. This is especially useful when dealing with binary files, such as images, executables, etc.

There are many hex editors out there, each with its own features and advantages. Here are some of the hex editors I recommend:
### 010 Editor

[010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) is a commercial hex editor with a free trial. It has a nice GUI and a lot of features, including a template system that allows you to parse binary files into a structured view.  
This is my personal favorite hex editor, and I use it for most of my CTF challenges.

#### Pros

- Nice GUI
- Template system with more than 200 templates
- Cross-platform
- Free trial

#### Cons

- Commercial, not cheap

### HxD

[HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) is a free hex editor with a nice GUI and a lot of features. It's a great choice for Windows users.

#### Pros

- Nice GUI

#### Cons

- Windows only
