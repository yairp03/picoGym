# Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Buffer overflow vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when a program tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary storage area) than it can hold. This can cause the extra data to overflow into adjacent memory locations, corrupting or overwriting the data stored there. 

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by intentionally sending more data than the buffer can hold, causing the extra data to overwrite other parts of the program's memory. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, crash the program, or even take control of the system.

To prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities, it is important to ensure that programs properly validate input data and limit the amount of data that can be stored in a buffer. Additionally, using programming languages that provide built-in memory management, such as Java or Python, can help prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
