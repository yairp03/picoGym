# Format String Vulnerability

A format string vulnerability is a vulnerability caused by the programmer passing user input to a function that takes a format string as a parameter, like `printf`. The user input is then treated as a format string, and the function tries to print it. This can be exploited to leak data from the stack, or even to write to the stack.
