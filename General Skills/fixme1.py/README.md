# Challenge

## Description

Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag.  
[Download Python script](./fixme1.py)

## Source

[fixme1.py](./fixme1.py) (Python script)

# Solution

Opening the python script, we can see that there is an indentation error on line 20, and the `print` statement is too indented. Fixing the indentation and running the script, we get the flag:

```
$ python3 fixme1.py
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_182342f7}
```

**The Flag:** `picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_182342f7}`
