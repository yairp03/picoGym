## Description

What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)?

# Solution

To answer this question, we can simply use python's ability to automatically convert hexadecimal numbers to decimal numbers:

```python

61
```

Wrapping the result in `picoCTF{}` gives us the flag.

**The Flag:** `picoCTF{61}`
